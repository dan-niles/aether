# Aether

## Background

This project was developed by _Team Straw Hats_ during the Tech Triathlon hosted by [Rootcode](https://rootcodelabs.com/).

### Problem statement

The Intergalactic organization wants to start their own space travel agency. They understand that booking
interplanetary travel tickets can be a complex and confusing process. Therefore, Intergalacticâ€™s goal is to provide an
application that simplifies the booking process and provides a seamless user experience for citizens travelling from one
planet to another. Intergalactic has reached out to our team to develop their Interplanetary travel application.

### Requirements

The primary goal of this application is that it should have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the booking process step
by step. The following requirements were requested:

- Design a mobile-first solution. 
- Users should be able to search and compare travel options by travel mode, destination, price, and departure date.
- Users should be able to view detailed information about their destination before making a decision, including climate, culture, and popular tourist attractions.
- Users should be able to enter their personal information and payment details easily.
- Users should be able to access their booking information through the application.

## Design

The wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes we designed in Figma for this project can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/qHEIX9aWKrSiyBTGJMDe8k/Aether?type=design&node-id=65-762&mode=design&t=3ZcbQRyEpn0WYahN-0).
